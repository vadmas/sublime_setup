# sublime_setup
This is my sublime text 3 configuration. To set up on fresh install of sublime, you:

- remove the User folder of the fresh install
- clone your backup into a new User Folder (only the User folder)
- install Package Control
- restart Sublime Text (Packages will automatically install)
